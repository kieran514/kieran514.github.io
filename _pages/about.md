### Background

Passionate Computer Vision Engineer with a deep expertise in Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation and 3D Reconstruction. Proud recipient of the Department Prize in Mathematics and the Final Year Project Prize at Aston University for groundbreaking work in monocular depth estimation. Honored to have an accepted paper at the prestigious ICCV conference. Committed to transforming 2D images into insightful 3D perspectives.

I hold a degree in Mathematics from Aston University, and my academic background in computer science is strong.

- [12/2023] From 17th to 21st, I will attend the 2023 IMS International Conference on Statistics and Data Science (ICSDS) in Lisbon, where I will give a contributed talk on our COLT paper [A High-dimensional Convergence Theorem for U-statistics with Applications to Kernel-based Testing](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v195/huang23a.html).

- [10/2023] For this academic year, I will be visiting the [Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning](https://fsml-ucl.github.io/) research group, co-led by Dr [Fran√ßois-Xavier Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io/) and Dr [Jeremias Knoblauch](https://jeremiasknoblauch.github.io/). Looking forward to an engaging experience with the amazing researchers in the group!

- [10/2023] Starting from October 2023, I will become an [Enrichment Student](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment) at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), where I will join the Turing's research community for six months to broaden my research. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you are interested in collaboration!

- [05/2023] Our paper [A High-dimensional Convergence Theorem for U-statistics with Applications to Kernel-based Testing](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v195/huang23a.html) has been accepted by COLT 2023.

- [04/2023] Our paper [Using Perturbation to Improve Goodness-of-Fit Tests based on Kernelized Stein Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14762) has been accepted by ICML 2023.

- [09/2022] I finished my internship at [Meta](https://research.facebook.com/), where I worked on multi-task active learning methods for e-commerce.

- [01/2022] Our paper [Grassmann Stein Variational Gradient Descent](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/liu22a.html) has been accepted by AISTATS 2022.
