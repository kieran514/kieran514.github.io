### Background

Hello, I am a Researcher in the Computer Science department at Aston University. My research focuses on self-supervised monocular depth estimation and pose estimation. We develop state-of-the-art depth robustness at different times of day, weather conditions, and image degradations. The goal is to create practical and lightweight models that can be used to replace expensive sensors for a variety of tasks. 

I have obtained a mathematics degree from Aston University and have a strong background in computer science.
