## Background

As a passionate Computer Vision Engineer, my journey has been driven by a deep fascination with Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation and 3D Reconstruction. My dedication and hard work have been recognized with the Department Prize in Mathematics and the Final Year Project Prize at Aston University, where I made significant strides in monocular depth estimation.

I am thrilled to share that I have two papers submitted, one of which has been accepted at the prestigious ICCV conference, a testament to my commitment and expertise in the field. I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of transforming 2D images into insightful 3D perspectives, blending innovation with rigorous academic research.
