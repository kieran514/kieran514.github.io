title: "Portfolio item number 1"
excerpt: "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has
been a subject of intense study in recent years, because of
its applications in robotics and autonomous driving. Much of
the recent work focuses on improving depth estimation by
increasing architecture complexity. This paper shows that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by improving the
learning process rather than increasing model complexity. More
specifically, we propose (i) disregarding small potentially dynamic objects when training, and (ii) employing an appearance-based approach to separately estimate object pose for truly dynamic objects. We demonstrate that these simplifications reduce
GPU memory usage by 29% and results in qualitatively and
quantitatively improved depth maps. The code is available at
